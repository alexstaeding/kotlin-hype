## The Power of Kotlin

The power of Kotlin, it's a force so strong
It's got us coding all day long
With its concise syntax and its null safety features
We'll be writing code like it's nobody's business

### Chorus:
The power of Kotlin, it's a language that we adore
It's got us feeling like we can code anything
The power of Kotlin, it's a language we can't ignore
It's got us feeling like we can conquer the world

### Verse 2:
It's got extensions and lambdas and higher-order functions
It's got coroutines and data classes and sealed hierarchies
It's got everything we need to build our applications
And with Kotlin, we'll be unstoppable

### Chorus:
The power of Kotlin, it's a language that we adore
It's got us feeling like we can code anything
The power of Kotlin, it's a language we can't ignore
It's got us feeling like we can conquer the world

We'll write our code in Kotlin, and we'll never look back
It's the best choice for our Android apps, there's no doubt about that
With Kotlin, we'll be unstoppable, we'll rule the world of code
The power of Kotlin, it's a language that we'll always hold dear

### Chorus:
The power of Kotlin, it's a language that we adore
It's got us feeling like we can code anything
The power of Kotlin, it's a language we can't ignore
It's got us feeling like we can conquer the world
